# Priority 1 Tasks Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. RPC Function Integration
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

All major API endpoints have been updated to use the atomic RPC functions defined in `supabase/rpc_functions.sql`:

#### Updated Endpoints:
1. **`/api/create-market`** 
   - Uses `create_market_with_bet` RPC function
   - Already implemented with proper error handling

2. **`/api/place-bet`**
   - Uses `place_bet` RPC function
   - Handles credit verification atomically
   - Already implemented with proper error handling

3. **`/api/resolve-bet`**
   - Uses `resolve_bet` RPC function
   - Handles payout distribution atomically
   - Updated to use standardized error handling utilities

4. **`/api/ai-arbitrate`**
   - Uses `resolve_bet` RPC function for AI decisions
   - Updated to use standardized error handling utilities

### 2. Standardized Error Handling
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

All API endpoints now use the standardized error handling utilities from `/lib/api-utils.ts`:

- `withErrorHandling` wrapper for consistent error responses
- `requireAuth` for authentication checks
- `validateFields` for input validation
- `APIError` class for structured error handling
- Consistent response formats using `createSuccessResponse` and `createErrorResponse`

### 3. Enhanced User Balance Endpoint
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

The `/api/user/balance` endpoint has been enhanced to:
- Use standardized error handling
- Provide more detailed information including:
  - Current balance
  - Recent transactions
  - Active bets
  - Statistics (total transactions, active bets count, total staked)

## Benefits of These Updates

1. **Atomic Operations**: Using RPC functions ensures database consistency and prevents race conditions
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: All endpoints now return errors in a predictable format
3. **Better Security**: Authentication and validation are handled consistently across all endpoints
4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Standardized patterns make it easier to add new endpoints

## Next Steps

The original Priority 1 tasks from the BACKEND_INCOMPLETE_FEATURES.md have been completed. The document has been updated to show new Priority 1 features:

1. ✅ Appeals System - COMPLETED
2. ✅ User Profile Management - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Bet Cancellation - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Social Features - COMPLETED

3. **Features**:
   - Username validation (3-30 characters, unique)
   - Avatar URL validation (must be valid image URL)
   - Notification preferences as JSON
   - User statistics including win rate, total bets, winnings
   - Automatic updated_at timestamp

### To Run the Migration:
Execute the following SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```

## Bet Cancellation Implementation (COMPLETED)

### Implemented Features:

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/bets/[id]/cancel` - Cancel a bet (creator only, before deadline)

2. **Database Migration**:
